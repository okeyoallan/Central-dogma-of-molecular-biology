Copying a double stranded DNA molecule
to get to identical copies of each.  

Produce two identical pieces of DNA from a single piece of DNA material.    

Neccessitates the cell division such that each daughter cell contains the exact copies of the genetic materials as the parent.   

Requires the following;    

    * DNA 
    * DNA helicase
    * SSBP - single strand bindging proteins
    * DNA ligase
    * DNA polymerase III
    * RNA primase
    * DNA polymerase

# Stages of DNA replication    


 1. Unwinding
 2. Binding of primers
 3. Extension
 4. Ligation
