Synthesis of a protein from a molecule of an mRNA.    
**Takes place in the ribosomes located in the cytoplasm of the cell .**    


It takes place through the following steps;  

  1. Initiation, a ribosome bind on the mRNA, forms tranlation initiation complex. tRNA bearing methionine locates and bind the statrt codon 'AUG' corresponding to methionine to intitiate the process of protein synthesis.

  2. Elongation, more codons are exposed, and tRNAs with corresponding codons bind to the mRNA strand forming a longer chain of polypeptide molecules.    

  3. Termination, occurs when a stop codon i.e UAA, UAG is exposed. The ribosome signals the end of translation and the newly formed proteins is released, as illustrated below.
