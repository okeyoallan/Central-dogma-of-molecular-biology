Copying of the genetic code at a specific location from a DNA molecule.    

**Not every DNA is a gene and not every gene is a DNA.**

*Below is an illustration of transcription process*

This is the sequence that will act as the blue print to the end protein.    

The stages involved during transcription include;    

  1. Initiation, transcription factors bind to enhancer and promoter, recruiting RNA polymerases
  The three therefore forms a transcription initiation complex which initiates the transcrition process.
  
  2. Elongation, addition of complimentary bases to the DNA strand.    
  3. Termination, RNA polymerase drops off upon reaching a terminator sequence.    
  Examples of terminator mechanisms include, Rho dependent and Rho independent, shown in prokaryotes
