# This is a basic introduction to the central dogma of molecular biology.    

**It is the flow of genetic information within a biological system.**    


It can be illustrated as;

Generally comprises the following steps:    

    * Replication 
    * Transcription
    * Translation    
    
    
    
    
# DNA    
Deoxyribonucleic acid.    
Made up of;   
  * A phosphate group    
  
  * Sugar group, Deoxyribose or 2-deoxy-D-ribose sugar (OH replaced with H atom) eg Deoribose, fucose 6-deoxy-L-galactose component of fucoidan of brown algae,   Rhamnose 6-deoxy-L-mannose in plant glycosides....    
  
  * Nucleotides, A,C,T,G.     
  
  * Phosphate backbone is formed by the linkage between the 5th phosphate group of one nucleotide and the 3rd OH group of the other. 
     
  * Nucleoside, made up of a purine or a pyrimidine and a 5 carbon ribose sugar.  
   
  * Nuleotide, a nucleoside with an additional phosphate group(s).    
  
  * A chain of nucleotides (polynucleotides) with the sugar-Ribonucleotides eg RNA.    
  
  * Polynucleotides with 2' OH group removed, forms DNA.

  * The dsDNA in eukaryotes is wound 1.7 times around histone proteins to form chromatins.This helps in; 
      * Compressing the DNA to fit the cell
      * Makes the DNA accessible for transcription, regulation of expression, repair and recombination.
  * The chromatins are further packaged together to form chromosomes which are stored in the nucleus of the cell.
