# This is a basic introduction to the central dogma of molecular biology.    

**It is the flow of genetic information within a biological system.**    


It can be illustrated as;

Generally comprises the following steps:    

    * Replication 
    * Transcription
    * Translation    
    
    
    
    
# DNA    
Deoxyribonucleic acid.    
Made up of;   
  * A phosphate group    
  
  * Sugar group, Deoxyribose or 2-deoxy-D-ribose sugar (OH replaced with H atom) eg Deoribose, fucose 6-deoxy-L-galactose component of fucoidan of brown algae,   Rhamnose 6-deoxy-L-mannose in plant glycosides....    
  
  * Nucleotides, A,C,T,G.     
  
  * Phosphate backbone is formed by the linkage between the 5th phosphate group of one nucleotide and the 3rd OH group of the other. 
     
  * Nucleoside, made up of a purine or a pyrimidine and a 5 carbon ribose sugar.  
   
  * Nuleotide, a nucleoside with an additional phosphate group(s).    
  
  * A chain of nucleotides (polynucleotides) with the sugar-Ribonucleotides eg RNA.    
  
  * Polynucleotides with 2' OH group removed, forms DNA.

  * The dsDNA in eukaryotes is wound 1.7 times around histone proteins to form chromatins.This helps in; 
      * Compressing the DNA to fit the cell
      * Makes the DNA accessible for transcription, regulation of expression, repair and recombination.
  * The chromatins are further packaged together to form chromosomes which are stored in the nucleus of the cell.

# Mutation
_It is the random alterations in the geetic material or the genetic sequence of an organism.     
_They are the sole reason for genetic diversity.    
_Could occur as a result of accidents during the normal chemical transactions of DNA, often during replication.       
_ In addition, it might occur due to exposure to high-energy electromagnetic radiation such as UV radiations an X-rays, particle radiation or to highly reactive chemicals in the environment.     
_ Mutations that occur solely in the body cells are classified as *Somatic mutations* and are often passed on to successive offprings during DNA replication.    
_ Mutations in the reproductive cells are classified as *Germline mutations* and are the common causes of severe genetic disorders in most organisms such as Cystic Fibrosis in human. They are inherited to offsprings whose entire germline cells are affected by or carry the mutation. 

Mutations are broadly categorized into;     
     * Point mutation
     * Frameshift mutations 
     
## Types of mutation
 * Silent mutation, which are changes in the DNA (gene sequence) that do not result in the significant change in the resultatnt amino acid sequence, poses no effect.   
 *  Miscence mutation, causes changes in the codon resulting in a different amino acid, can result in the final protein being non functional. Commonly associated with diseases such as Sickle cell anaemie.
 *  Nonesnece mutation, alteration in the codon resulting into a premature stop codon. Also renders the protein non functional. Has been associated with congenital adrenal hyperplesia.
 *  Deletion, irreversible removal of one or more nucleotides resulting in the change of the reading frame.  REsults in a completely altered non-functional protein.
 *  Insertion, the addition of one or more amino acids in the sequence of DNA mainly by transposable elements and during replication of repeating elements. Can be reversed by excision of the transposons. Can as well result in a non-functional protein, a mulfunctioning protein and the protein may as well be destroyed by the mechanisms of the body.
